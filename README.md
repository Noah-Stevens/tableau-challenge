All of work is in the CitiBikeBook Tableau file and the analysis text file.

The assignment contains three parts:

  1. Creating visualizations and putting ones that are relevant to one another into dashboards
  2. Craft a story using the visualizations and dashboards to paint a larger picture of their purpose and connection
  3. Write an analysis using the tableau book related to the visualizations used.

This showcases the ability to utilize many features in Tableau, such as creating maps and plots, utilizing formatting and creating a more exploratory analysis of data.

Thanks for reading! :))
